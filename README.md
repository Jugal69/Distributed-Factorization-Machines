# Distributed-Factorization-Machines
Implementation of Distributed Factorization Machines in linear time.

1) Built an efficient Factorization Machine (FM) to analyze the Netflix Movie Ratings Dataset; which comprises of about 18,000
movies & 5,00,000 users.
2) Addressed the issue of dealing with large Sparse matrices generated during the training procedure of Stochastic Gradient 
Descent (SGD) by having a distributed implementation of FM with Linear time complexity.
3) Tools Used: Python, PySpark, Hadoop, Matplotlib.
